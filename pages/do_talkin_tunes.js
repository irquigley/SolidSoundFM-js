          Here is the production process. Like most things, it&apos;s flexible

            Select tunes YOU like, and be prepared to discuss the artistic merit
            of them. Why did you pick this one? Some people say to me &quot;I
            know you don&apos;t like xyz so I didn&apos;t pick that&quot;. Pick
            what you like.

        <Heading2>How to Talk</Heading2>
        <Para color="grey">
          From a very early age, you probably started talking and never really
          gave it much thought. Which is normal. This section isn&apos;t
          important, but it&apos;s helpful to some people and I&apos;ve built up
          this &apos;hints&apos; guide over time
        </Para>

        <BoxGroup color="orange">
          <Box title="Shy?">
            If you&apos;re feeling shy or nervous, I have years of experience
            helping people through that.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Edit">
            I edit the chat. I cut out all the erms, yeah, you know what I mean,
            &quot;it&apos;s like, it&apos;s like&quot; type stuff to make it
            sound sharp.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Don't Panic">
            We can pause, rewind and do whatever. If you want to stop to get a
            drink, look up some info, internet stopped or someone interrupted
            you. That&apos;s no problem at all.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Casual">
            Imagine we are in the pub, having a drink and one of these tunes
            comes on. The conversation goes &quot;oh this tune, I love it
            because... &quot; or &quot;did you know that&quot;. This is what
            talking tunes is about.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Notes">
            Take notes on yourself. When did you start DJing, producing, doing
            your thing. Who are your influences, who do you look up to. Any
            interesting anecdotes from going to raves? We will go into
            &apos;interview&apos; mode.
          </Box>
          <Box title="No Script">
            There is NO script. If you want to talk about something specific,
            just be blunt with me and say &quot;I want to talk about my new
            book&quot; before or during recording. I&apos;ll work that in
            naturally and edit it
          </Box>
          <Box title="Pre-Chat">
            Pre-chat, and Pre-Chat-chat. I can call you a day or two before we
            talk, just to talk and say hello (Pre-chat-chat). When I call you on
            the day, we&apos;ll Pre-chat just to go over stuff, check sound
            levels etc.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Structured">
            Normal chat is back and forth. However, in this format, it&apos;s
            you we want to hear so I let you talk and talk... and rarely
            interrupt. I might use &quot;false ignorance&quot; and ask a stupid
            question for the sake of conversation &quot;so, what is Drum and
            Bass?&quot;. If we talked about something &apos;off air&apos; avoid
            saying &quot;like we talked about before&quot; or &quot;like I said
            earlier&quot;
