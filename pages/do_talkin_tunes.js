          Here is the production process. Like most things, it@&apos;s flexible
          and we can figure out what works.

          <Box title="Step 2. ME">
            I produce a backing track from this list. The Backing Track is just
            over an hour, and is a SoundCloud private.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Step 3. Both">
            We agree a time, and I&apos;ll call you via Facebook Voice Chat, or
            Skype, or Whatsapp or any &quot;talk over the internet via
            computer&quot; application you like.

          For your set-up, it would be great if you have Headphones and then
          listen to the Backing Track on your computer at the same time as me,
          while we talk. If you have a microphone, that&apos;s great. Or a
          headset, if that works for you.

        <Heading2>15 Tunes ... is an hour and a bit</Heading2>
        <Article>
          <ParaNormal>
            We&apos;re aiming for something between an hour to an hour and
            thirty minutes, which is typically 15 tunes.
            <br />
            If all your are short and add up to less than an hour, feel free to
            add more.
            <br />
            If your tunes add up to more than 90 minutes, either cut them down
            yourself, or I will do that.

          <BoxGroup color="pink">
            <Box title="Selection">
              Aim for 80% Rave/Electronic tunes and if you want throw in some
              curveballs, jazz, classical, metal, folk, whatever, go for it.
            </Box>

            <Box title="You Like It">
              Select tunes YOU like, and be prepared to discuss the artistic
              merit of them. Why did you pick this one? Some people say to me
              &quot;I know you don&apos;t like xyz so I didn&apos;t pick
              that&quot;. Pick what you like.

              If you can send me the digital files for your selection, that

              Do a little background research. People love hearing nuggets of

        <Heading2>How to Talk</Heading2>
        <ParaNormal>
          From a very early age, you probably started talking and never really
          gave it much thought. Which is normal. This section isn&apos;t
          important, but it&apos;s helpful to some people and I&apos;ve built up
          this &apos;hints&apos; guide over time
        </ParaNormal>

        <BoxGroup color="orange">
          <Box title="Shy?">
            If you&apos;re feeling shy or nervous, I have years of experience
            helping people through that.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Edit">
            I edit the chat. I cut out all the erms, yeah, you know what I mean,
            &quot;it&apos;s like, it&apos;s like&quot; type stuff to make it
            sound sharp.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Don't Panic">
            We can pause, rewind and do whatever. If you want to stop to get a
            drink, look up some info, internet stopped or someone interrupted
            you. That&apos;s no problem at all.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Casual">
            Imagine we are in the pub, having a drink and one of these tunes
            comes on. The conversation goes &quot;oh this tune, I love it
            because... &quot; or &quot;did you know that&quot;. This is what
            talking tunes is about.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Notes">
            Take notes on yourself. When did you start DJing, producing, doing
            your thing. Who are your influences, who do you look up to. Any
            interesting anecdotes from going to raves? We will go into
            &apos;interview&apos; mode.
          </Box>
          <Box title="No Script">
            There is NO script. If you want to talk about something specific,
            just be blunt with me and say &quot;I want to talk about my new
            book&quot; before or during recording. I&apos;ll work that in
            naturally and edit it
          </Box>
          <Box title="Pre-Chat">
            Pre-chat, and Pre-Chat-chat. I can call you a day or two before we
            talk, just to talk and say hello (Pre-chat-chat). When I call you on
            the day, we&apos;ll Pre-chat just to go over stuff, check sound
            levels etc.
          </Box>
          <Box title="Structured">
            Normal chat is back and forth. However, in this format, it&apos;s
            you we want to hear so I let you talk and talk... and rarely
            interrupt. I might use &quot;false ignorance&quot; and ask a stupid
            question for the sake of conversation &quot;so, what is Drum and
            Bass?&quot;. If we talked about something &apos;off air&apos; avoid
            saying &quot;like we talked about before&quot; or &quot;like I said
            earlier&quot;
